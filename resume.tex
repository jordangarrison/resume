% \section{Other information}

% \subsection{Review}

% Infrastructure engineer quickly distinguished in Architecture and design of big data systems.
% Main experience in the Hadoop Ecosystem implementing role based access and automation to the Hortonworks Stack.
% I am a quick learner and I love to program a solution if it is possible.
% I prefer to take a longer framework oriented approach to problems for better overall architecture and future proofing platforms to for scale and new implementations.

% \subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
