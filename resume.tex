\section{Experience}

\begin{twenty} % Environment for a list with descriptions
	\twentyitem{2017-Now}{Hadoop Platform Engineer}{General Motors}{At General Motors, I work as a Hadoop Platform Engineer to deploy and implement new technologies into the Hadoop stack.
	This involves engineering and supporting 15 PB core production clusters and multiple development environments for our Business and Data Science users.
	Projects listed below.
	
	\textbf{Ranger and Atlas} - As the Technical Lead, deployed role-based access to Hadoop production environments.
	Led a team under a tight timeline to implement Ranger and Atlas services, which allowed easier on-boarding and off-boarding of groups into the Hadoop environment.
	
	\textbf{Automated Yarn Queue Scheduler} - Developed a client based tool written in Go to allow for automated switching of the Yarn Queues for day and night workloads.
	This implemented Kerberos authentication with no client dependencies utilizeing SPNEGO authorization to the kerberized Ambari server.
	This led to the development of a framework of libraries and API's to build new tooling off of.
	Currently, working this tool into a framework to provide automation of all cluster operations.
	
	\textbf{Hadoop Monitoring System} - Authored and maintain a 10,000+ Line Python code base for monitoring cluster metrics from a remote system through the Ambari API's metrics.
	This system was integrated into Prometheus and an Oracle database to allow for frontend visualizations to be created using Grafana and a custom PHP dashboard.
	Currently, working to revamp this with a team to better utilize the Prometheus exporter ecosystem to allow fore more scalable monitoring.}

	\twentyitem{2016-2017}{Research Technician and Python Developer}{Lynntech Inc.}{At Lynntech, I developed IoT devices and scientific instruments using Python and the Arduino programming language.
	Projects listed below.
	
	\textbf{Iodine Detector} - This was a small embedded device which detected iodine absorbance in cartridges as a countermeasure in areas of the world where the water system did not meet regulatory standards for iodine content to prevent large outbreaks of hyperthyroidism.
	The core skills utilized in the project were circuit design, Python programming, Qt GUI design, and extensive testing of device consistency.
	
	\textbf{Salination Level Detection} - This project was a demo where the team took sea water and purified it to drinkable water.
	My role was to integrate the pH and saline sensors with an Arduino board to validate safe drinking levels.
	Programmed in the Arduino programming language using the I2C interface to the chips for the sensor probes.}%% [[YOU ARE HERE]]
	
	\twentyitem{2014}{Data Analyst}{Texas A\&M Department of Physics and Astronomy}{Research role in the Texas A\&M Department of Physics and Astronomy. Worked as a data analyst under Ricardo Eusebi Ph.D. running simulations of the Higg's Boson particle.
	Programmed in C++ and Bash to run proton collision simulations to produce the Higg's occurrence.
	This was my introduction into cluster computing and data analytics.}

% \section{Other information}

% \subsection{Review}

% Infrastructure engineer quickly distinguished in Architecture and design of big data systems.
% Main experience in the Hadoop Ecosystem implementing role based access and automation to the Hortonworks Stack.
% I am a quick learner and I love to program a solution if it is possible.
% I prefer to take a longer framework oriented approach to problems for better overall architecture and future proofing platforms to for scale and new implementations.

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
